    "Applying a novel machine learning architecture to a new task can be a complex undertaking, and usually involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Implement new code for the model architecture (Pytorch or TensorFlow)\n",
    "2. Load the pretrained weights from a server if they are available\n",
    "3. Preprocess the inputs, pass them throught the model, and apply some task-specific postprocessing\n",
    "4. Implement dataloaders and define loss functions and optimizers to train the model\n",

    "Transfer learning is one of the key factors driving the sucess of transformers because it makes it possible to reuse pretrained models for new tasks. So, it is crucial to be able to load pretrained models quickly and run experiments with them. The Hugging Face Hub hosts over 20000 freely avalaible models. As shown in the figure below, there are filters for tasks, datasets, framework and more. This makes experimenting with a wide range of models simple and allows you to focus on the domain-specific parts of your project.\n",

    "![Hugging Face Hub](images/HF_hub2.PNG)\n",
    "As you can see in the picture, the Hub hosts over 400000 freely available models. It is possible to filter the models by tasks, librairies, datasets and more. You can load a model with just `one line of code`. This makes experimenting with a wide range of models simple, and allows to focus on the domain-specific parts of your project. \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">One of the coolest features of the Hub is that you can try out any model directly through the various task-specific interactive widgets.</span>\n",

    "2. **Hugging Face Tokenizers** Behind each of the pipeline examples is a tokenization step that splits the raw text into smaller pieces called `tokens`. This is one of the most important librairy provides by Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hugging Face Datasets**: Loading, processing and storing datasets can be a cumbersome process especially when the datasets get too large. In addition, you usually need to implement various scripts to download the data and transform it into a standard format. Datasets librairy simplifies this process by providing a standard interface for thousands of datasets that can be found on the Hub.\n",
